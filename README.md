# GTD - Machine Learning project
This project Contain 3 parts:
1. Scraping process - from the [Global Terrorisem Database](https://www.start.umd.edu/gtd/) which can be viewed in the following jupyter notebook: [get-dataset.ipynb](https://github.com/devalornir/gtd-project/blob/main/get-dataset.ipynb)
2. Scraping results are stored in an .csv file called [output.csv](https://github.com/devalornir/gtd-project/blob/main/output.csv)
3. Data handling, visualization(EDA), Train & Test, and compiling results to prediction.can viewed in the following jupyter notebook: [approch2.ipynb](https://github.com/devalornir/gtd-project/blob/main/approch2.ipynb)
